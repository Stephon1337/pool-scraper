# Legendary Postcard Design System

Creative directives for the AquaDesk Postcard Generator. Every layout must feel like a $500 Fiverr designer built it — not a template engine.

## Composition Rules

| Principle | Standard (Reject) | Legendary (Enforce) |
|---|---|---|
| **Layout** | Center-aligned everything | Asymmetrical balance — heavy left- or right-justified to force eye-scanning. If logo is left, primary offer goes extreme right. |
| **Typography** | Single safe font, uniform size | Display + Minimal Sans pairing (e.g., Playfair Display + Satoshi/Geist). Oversized kerning for premium feel. Headlines can bleed off-edge or run vertical. |
| **Color Math** | Stock blue/white pool palette | Tonal palettes: 3 shades of deep navy + single high-vibrancy accent (Safety Orange, Acid Lime, Neon Cyan). 60-30-10 rule enforced. |
| **White Space** | Fill every pixel | 80% negative space with single high-contrast offer in center converts better than clutter. Use emptiness as a weapon. |
| **Grid** | Standard centered grid | Golden Ratio grids and Rule of Thirds as minimum. Break the grid intentionally for visual tension. |

## Visual Hierarchy Directives

- **Brand Bleed:** Logo or brand watermark bleeds off card edge — creates sense of scale and premium confidence.
- **Glitch & Brutalist Mode:** When applied, don't just tint — distort the CTA with high visual tension (oversized fonts, heavy drop shadows at 10px offsets, solid high-contrast blocks instead of glassmorphism).
- **Abstract Textures:** Instead of defaulting to pool photos, offer "Refracted Water Light" abstract textures for a modern art direction.
- **Contextual CTA:** Replace generic "Call Now" with situation-aware CTAs: "Is Your Pool Ready? Text [Code] to (xxx) xxx-xxxx" — personalized, action-specific.

## Psychological Conversion Triggers

- **Odd Pricing:** Use $97 instead of $100. $197 instead of $200. Odd numbers convert 15-21% better.
- **Red CTA Accents:** Red/orange call-to-action elements outperform blue by ~21% in direct mail.
- **Cliffhanger Front→Back:** The front creates a question only the back answers. Force the customer to flip: "What 3 Things Are Destroying Your Pool This Summer?" → back has the answer + offer.
- **Phone as Hero:** Phone number must be the single most readable element on the card. Minimum 14px equivalent, high contrast, never buried in a paragraph.

## Luxury Tier Logic

For high-end / "Brand Name" appeals:
- Pair a state-level sans-serif (Satoshi, Geist, Inter) with a classic high-contrast serif (Playfair Display, Cormorant).
- Monochrome palette + single metallic/gold accent.
- Architectural photography over stock pool photos.
- Brand cohesion: every color extracted from imagery must tint typography. No "stock white text" unless deliberate high-contrast choice.

## Implementation Verification

For every new layout, verify:
1. Does the design include a red/orange CTA accent?
2. Is odd pricing used when discount amounts appear?
3. Is the phone number the most readable element?
4. Does the front→back create a flip motivation (cliffhanger)?
5. Does the composition use asymmetry, not center-align-everything?
6. Is negative space used intentionally, not just "leftover"?
